# CrashUrPC
THIS IS A FILE THAT SETS U IN A BOOTLOOP... U CAN ONLY DESTROY THE FILE IF U ARE IN WINDOWS SAFE MODE. SO DONT USE UNLESS U WANT TO KNOW WHAT U ARE DOING.

I made this Programm to test my antivirus.
This Programm first looks normal, then opens itself in fullscreen and locks the mouse and keyboard input. At the same time its going to load a .bat script in startup dir that contains "shutdown -s -t 0". This file is only copying the bat in the C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup directory, but u can change the dir to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp if u want the .bat to execute faster

If u cant stop it from running, go to ur lockscreen before the bat starts by pressing WIN+L then press and hold shift and restart ur PC by pressing the restart button in the bottomright corner. Then Press Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Startup Settings. then press the restart button. after the restart u will see a list with options. Just press the number 4. after that ur Pc is restarting again, but in safemode this time. after the restart press WIN+R and type in "shell:startup" if u use the C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup folder. if u used the C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp folder type "%programdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp" in the window that pops up. Then just delete the File called "Windows_configurations.bat" or whatever u called the .bat. There should be only 1 file in this folder if u never used this folder before so its not posible to delete the wrong file.

!!DONT USE THIS PROGRAMM TO SCAM SOMEONE!!
UNLESS: THE PERSON U WANT TO SCAM IS SCAMING OTHER PEOPLE! THEN TRY YOUR BEST AND CRASH THEIR PC's
